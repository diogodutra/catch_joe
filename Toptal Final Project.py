# The present Jupyter Notebook explains the process of creating a predictive model to classify an user access as **Joe** or **not-Joe** using this [dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nATkzOZUe6w5IWcFNE3AakzBl-6P-5Hw/view?usp=sharing).

# # 1 Load dataset

# In[3]:


file = 'data/dataset.json'

df = pd.read_json(file)

# create target label as a separate column
user_id_joe = 0
df['joe'] = df['user_id'] == user_id_joe

df.head()


# In[4]:


# split dataset into train and test
# in chronological order (not random)

test_ratio = 0.1
df_later = df.sort_values(by='date').tail(int(test_ratio * df.shape[0]))

df = df.drop(df_later.index) # train dataset

df.shape


# # 2 Data Exploration

# ## 2.1 Gender

# The first feature to be explored is `gender`. Let's explore the hypothesis that Joe never changed their gender.

# In[5]:


# sns.catplot(x='joe', hue='gender', kind='count', data=df)


# It seems that Joe is a male, since there is no log on his name as female. This insight is useful to discard around 40% of the dataset.

# ## 2.2 Location

# In[6]:


# locations = list(set(df['location']))
# print(len(locations), 'locations in the dataset:', *locations)


# Let's now explore `location`. Unless Joe works in a cruising ship, probably he has limited variation of location around the globe so let's explore this hypothesis.

# In[7]:


# sns.catplot(x='joe', hue='location', kind='count', data=df)


# In[8]:


# Counter(df[df['joe']]['location'])


# Joe has access logs from Paris, Chicago and Toronto only. This is helpful to discard the other 18 locations.

# ## 2.3 Language

# Let's now explore `locale`. It is rare to find an active polyglot so let's explore this hypothesis.

# In[9]:


# sns.catplot(x='joe', hue='locale', kind='count', data=df)


# In[10]:


# Counter(df[df['joe']]['locale'])


# Despite the fact that Joe has many access from France, USA and Canada, his sessions are always in Russian language. Again, this eliminates all the other languages.

# ## 2.4 Operating System

# If Joe is not a geek than he is probably using only one or two different `os`.

# In[11]:


# sns.catplot(x='joe', hue='os', kind='count', data=df)


# Indeed, Joe uses only Ubuntu and Windows 10. This rules out MacOS, Debian and the rest of the Microsoft's OS.

# ## 2.5 Browser

# For the same reason explained before for the OS, Joe is probably using only a couple of `browsers`.

# In[12]:


# sns.catplot(x='joe', hue='browser', kind='count', data=df)


# Again, Joe uses only Firefox and Chrome, ruling out Internet Explorer and Safari.

# ## 2.6 Time of the day

# Let's now verify the hypothesis that Joe accesses internet only in some specific hours of the day.

# In[13]:


def extract_hour(df):
    return [int(time.split(':')[0]) for time in df['time']]


# df['hour'] = extract_hour(df)
# sns.catplot(x='joe', hue='hour', kind='count', data=df)


# In[14]:


# print('Hours of the day with Joe\'s accesses:', *set(df[df['joe']]['hour']))


# It seems that Joe never accesses internet at some specific hours of the day. Therefore, this is yet another relevant information to be used by our classifier.

# ## 2.7 Day of the week

# Following the rationale from the previous subsection, let's verify the hypothesis that Joe accesses internet only in some specific days of the week.

# In[15]:


# df['weekday'] = [date.day_name() for date in df['date']]

# sns.catplot(x='joe', hue='weekday', kind='count', data=df)


# In[16]:


# Counter(df[df['joe']]['weekday'])


# There is no particular day of the week that shows an unusual history of access from Joe, so let's drop this feature.

# ## 2.8 Day of the month

# Let's verify if Joe has different frequency of accesses along the days of the month.

# In[17]:


# df['monthday'] = [date.day for date in df['date']]

# sns.catplot(x='joe', hue='monthday', kind='count', data=df)


# There is no unusual pattern to be extracted out of the day of the month.

# ## 2.9 Month of the year

# Now let's check if there is any useful pattern along the months of the year.

# In[18]:


# df['month'] = [date.month for date in df['date']]

# sns.catplot(x='joe', hue='month', kind='count', data=df)


# Again, nothing useful from the month of the year.

# ## 2.10 Duration

# In[19]:


def extract_duration(df):
    return [sum(map(lambda x: x.get('length'), sites)) for sites in df['sites']]


df['duration'] = extract_duration(df)


# Plotting the duration would be a bit harder to analyse. Intead, let's compare the duration statistics of the population against Joe's.

# In[20]:


# df['duration'].describe()


# In[21]:


# df[df['joe']]['duration'].describe()


# Joe's duration of access is fit within the statistical boundaries of the population, which means that there is nothing unusual. Nonetheless, let's keep this feature since it is slightly off the population statistics so it might have some useful correlation with other features.

# In[22]:

# In[35]:

# df_like_joe = df.copy()

# filter_data = {feat: set(df[df['joe']][feat]) for feat in features}

# for feature, valid_entries in filter_data.items():
#     df_like_joe = df_like_joe[df_like_joe[feature].isin(valid_entries)]

    
# # extract set of multiple website entries from Joe's logs
# # sites_joe = {site.get('site') for sites in df_like_joe['sites'] for site in sites}
# # df_like_joe = df_like_joe[list(map(lambda x:

# print('Like-Joe dataset contains', df_like_joe.shape[0], 'logs',
#      "({0:.0%}).".format(df_like_joe.shape[0] / df.shape[0]))


# Filtering out those logs that do not match Joe's history is enough to discard a large piece of the dataset.
# 
# But how many of the left logs are our Joe indeed?

# In[37]:


# count = Counter(df_like_joe['joe'])

# is_joe = np.asarray(list(count.values()))

# Despite the fact that the filter previously mentioned has efficiently removed most of the dataset, there are yet some logs from a few people with enough occurencies to be a majority over Joe. This is yet something to be tackled, since we don't want these people being taken as Joe.

# ## 3.2 Decision Tree

# Maybe, the cross combination of restrictions across different features is enough to find Joe out of the other few people above. For instance, Joe might be the only one who uses Firefox (`browser`) on Windows 10 (`os`).
# 
# Let's create a simple Decision Tree, train it on the single-entries categorical features and check it's performance to detect Joe.

# Before we move on to improve the performance, here is a question. How exactly does this Decision Tree above work in order to classify?
# 
# In order to help us answer this question, let's plot the nodes of the Decision Tree as a graph plot below.

# In[46]:


# dtreeviz(model, X_train, y_train,
#                 target_name="target",
#                 feature_names=features,
#                 class_names=['Joe', 'not Joe'])


# In[47]:


le['locale'].inverse_transform([18])


# The graph above shows that the Decision Tree queries the features in the following order:
# 1. If the language (`locale`) is less than 17.5 then is not Joe with 100% of certainty; else ...
# 1. If the language (`locale`) is more than 18.5 then is is not Joe with 100% of certainty; else ...
# 1. If the duration of access is less than 3.5 than it is Joe with 100% of certainty; else ...
# 1. We run out of questions so it guesses it is not Joe with roughly 10% of error.
# 
# Mind that `locale = 18` is the Russian language as coded by the `LabelEncoder`. Therefore, the first 2 questions above are mainly telling us that if the language of access is not Russian than it is not 
# Joe for sure.
# 
# Another observtion is that the `duration` alone feature was not useful, as explained in the previous section. However, it became useful for the remaining cases that are exclusivelly Russian speakers.

# Let's try the performance of other more sophisticted models.
